An export facility for StepMania songs to Google Sheets.

## Installation

Place the Songs to Sheet folder in your StepMania top level directory (the one with _Songs_).

## Usage

### 1. Run "Songs to Sheet.exe"
* Data files (CSV) will be placed in a folder called "output" (eg. "Songs to Sheet/output/Singles.csv")

### 2. Import selected data file into Google sheets
* Open your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
* Open an existing spreadsheet. (or create and open a new spreadsheet, _New_ -> _Google Sheet_)
* _File_ -> _Import_ -> _Upload_
   * Navigate to your selected CSV file (_Songs to Sheet/output_) and select it for import.
* In the _Import file_ window
__NOTE__: Google Drive will leave a copy of the CSV file laying around, it can be removed after import

   * Choose your _Import location_
   * Set the _Separator type_ to _Custom_ and _semi-colon_ (;)
   * Check _Convert text to numbers, dates and formulas_
   * Click _Import Data_
   * Repeat for each selected file

### 3. Use the provided macro to format your sheet
__NOTE__: The macro is deemed "unsafe" by Google because it hasn't passed through their verification process.
If you're unsure about using it, feel free to skip this.

   * Replace the auto-generated code (__function myFunction() {}__) with the copied text and _Save_
   * Return to your Google Sheet
* _Tools_ -> _Macros_ -> _Import_
   * In the _Import_ window, click _Add function_ to the right of _formatSongSheet_ and close the _Import_ window
