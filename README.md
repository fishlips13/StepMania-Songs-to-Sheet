# StepMania 5 Songs to Sheet

An export facility for StepMania songs to Google Sheets

Windows only

## Installation

1. Download the latest zip from Releases

2. Extract the "Songs to Sheet" folder in your StepMania top level folder (the one with the "Songs" folder)

## Usage

### Run "Songs to Sheet.exe"

* Data files (CSV) will be placed in the "output" folder (eg. "Songs to Sheet/output/Singles.csv")

### Import selected data file into Google sheets

__NOTE__: Google Drive will leave a copy of the CSV file laying around, it can be removed after import

1. Open your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
2. Open a spreadsheet or create new (_New_ -> _Google Sheet_)
3. _File_ -> _Import_ -> _Upload_
   * Navigate to your selected CSV file ("Songs to Sheet/output") and select it for import.
   * Choose __Import location__
   * Change __Separator type__ to __Custom__ and "__;__" (semi-colon)
   * Check __Convert text to numbers, dates and formulas__
   * __Import Data__
   * Repeat for each selected file

### Use the provided macro to format your sheet

__NOTE__: The macro is deemed "unsafe" by Google because it hasn't passed through their verification process.
If you're unsure about using it, skip it and format the sheet manually.

1. Open your Google Sheet you wish to format
2. _Tools_ -> _Script Editor_
   * Click __Untitled Project__ at the top and rename the project to something memorable
   * On the left, rename __code.gs__ to __macros.gs__ (click the 3 dots on hover)
   * Copy the text from "Songs to Sheet/Google Sheets Macro.txt"
   * Replace the auto-generated code ("function myFunction() ...") with the copied text and _Save__
   * Return to your Google Sheet
3. _Tools_ -> _Macros_ -> _Import_
   * Click __Add function__ to the right of __formatSongSheet__ and close the window
4. _Tools_ -> _Macros_ -> _formatSongSheet_
   * Authorise the macro
   * _Continue_ -> Select/login to your account
   * A window will popup, "Google hasnâ€™t verified this app"
   * _Advanced_ -> _Go to YourProjectName (unsafe)_ -> _Allow_
5. _Tools_ -> _Macros_ -> _formatSongSheet_ (to run the macro for reals this time)
6. Repeat for each sheet
